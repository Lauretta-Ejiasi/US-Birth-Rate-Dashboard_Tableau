# US-Birth-Rate_Power-BI-Dashboard
US Birth Rate

In this project, I delved into the rich dataset on birth rates across different states in the US, leveraging Tableau's powerful visualization tools to uncover insightful trends and patterns. From analyzing variations in birth rates over the years to examining demographic factors influencing these trends, it was a fascinating journey through the data.

Through interactive dashboards and visually compelling charts, I aimed to not only present the data but also to tell a compelling story about the factors shaping birth rates in the US. Whether it's exploring regional disparities or identifying correlations with socioeconomic indicators, this project offered valuable insights into a crucial aspect of demographic dynamics.
